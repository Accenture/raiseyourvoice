# 📢 Raise Your Voice
## 📔 Full Play Rulebook

### *Raise Your Voice* is a strategy game created to help people understand and anticipate the impact of AI on communities in the Global South. 

Designed to reflect the world of grassroots community organizations and the experience of societies in flux, it gives participants insights into political contests and collaborations against a range of political circumstances. Players take on diverse roles — from local actors and NGOs to multinational corporations and researchers — navigating complex political and technological landscapes.

> ℹ️ **Tip**: **Bolded** terms refer to important in-game terms. They are explained below and can also be looked up in the glossary.

Each game of Raise Your Voice takes place over three rounds, during which players may achieve their specific **goals**. At the end of the last turn, the **Future Outcomes** of the society are determined before final scoring takes place.

The game is designed with two considerations in mind: the first is to represent its subject matter well enough to produce meaningful insights for participants; and the second is to be as playable as possible for anyone unfamiliar with such strategy games.

This game incorporates a variety of relevant factors – including background political structures, different strategic circumstances, alternative configurations of **actors**, **AI development** and **licensing**, **government intervention** and **local politics**.

The game can also be modified by its players to model situations not included in the game, by adding further **Political Climates** and **Scenarios** (see “Designing your own Scenarios” at the end of this rule book).

As for playability, while we strongly recommend that at least one person learns the game beforehand to act as **facilitator** (see ‘Playing your first game’ at the end of this rule book), many of the game systems run automatically, allowing the players to focus instead on the actions they will take each turn. By about midway through their first game, players should be comfortable with how it plays and the types of decisions they should take.

Inspired by [Accenture and CARE International research](https://www.careinternational.org.uk/news-stories/ai-and-the-global-south-making-ai-more-ethical-and-effective-through-inclusive-participation/), the game reflects real-world dynamics in regions experiencing rapid change and unequal power. It is already in use by facilitators and organisations around the world.

We hope that you and your organization can use this game for education, strategic planning, analysis and cohort building. Even serious games should be fun.

## 🏆 Winning The Game

The winner of a game of *Raise Your Voice* is ultimately decided by the highest score, but there are two ways to score points – achieving short term goals and influencing the future outcome in line with your long term goals. The game takes place over just a few short rounds, so players must decide how to focus their efforts to greatest effect.

> ℹ️ **Tip**: Many of the game systems require that dice are rolled to determine the result. While the number of dice that are rolled by vary, they always work the same way. The number of dice to roll is indicated with 🎲 emojis on all materials.
<br>Any roll of a ‘6’ is a success, meaning the outcome occurs in a way that helps players. Any roll of a ‘1’ is a failure and may have negative effects for players. 

<br>

## 🔰 First Play Mode

If you haven't played *Raise Your Voice* before, we highly recommend your start with the ‘First Play’ mode. This version of the game lets new players quickly jump into a game of *Raise Your Voice* without needing to understand every element of the complete game. Instead, we strip the game down to its essentials so players can learn the core gameplay of *Raise Your Voice*.

## 🐣 Playing Your First Game

Many people are unfamiliar with complex board games and can find them daunting. Here are some suggestions to make it easier for players as they familiarize themselves with the game:

- **Someone acts as facilitator.** Rather than opening the box and trying to play the game with everyone present for the first time, one individual should offer to be the facilitator of the game. This person should read the rules of *RYV* ahead of the game or even play a ‘solo’ round or two to internalize the rules. This individual can then instruct people on game day. Further, this person can direct all ‘automatic’ in-game activity.
- **Situate the players.** Be sure to read out the scenario text fully then ask each player to read out their actor and role descriptions. This helps players understand the game in a more immersive way.
- **Begin with how to win.** Explain to each player how they score points. This only happens in two ways – achieving individually assigned goals to gain points, or by influencing Future Outcomes in their favor. If players are in doubt about what to do, working to acquire points is a good strategy.
- **Introduce rules phase by phase rather than all at once.** Encourage players to use the Partnerships space. They should place their own marker there to indicate what they need from other players, and watch to see whether they might be able to help another player.
- **Embrace ambiguity.** Strategic games like *Raise Your Voice* are designed to mirror real-world complexity — where not all information is available, and outcomes are influenced by other people’s choices. Encourage players to act with incomplete information, follow their instincts, and adapt their plans as the game unfolds. Uncertainty is part of the experience — and part of the learning. Insight often comes not from knowing everything in advance, but from navigating complexity together.
- **Remind players that you can play the game more than once.** Even experienced gamers make rules and strategy mistakes when playing a game for the first time. Don’t worry too much and enjoy it. You can always play again!

# 🎲 Getting Ready to Play

## 🧩 Board Description

The game board records nearly all player activity, houses the AI tech and keeps record of the turns rounds and score. 



<img src="../images/ryv_board_index.png" width="100%" alt="Illustration of Raise Your Voice game board">

### ① Political Climate and Scenario
Select one Political Climate card and one Scenario card and place them in these spaces for the duration of the game.

### ② Local Communities
These four spaces represent the four different Local Communities (LC) in the society. During the game, players will take **actions** that may allow them to place 📢 **Influence** within them or resolve **Community Needs**. The **government** may also initiate **crackdowns** in these areas, which may remove player influence and limit activity in the affected spaces.

> 💡 **Hint**:  During the game, **Local Actors**, **CSOs** and **NGOs** will find it easier to place 📢 Influence in Local Communities than either **Researchers** or **MNCs**, both of whom struggle to directly affect these spaces.

### ③ Public Square
This represents the areas where **actors** communicate with the public and
government to influence public opinion. 📢 **Influence** placed here indirectly affects **Local Communities** and directly affects **Future Outcomes**.

> 💡 **Hint**: In game terms, **MNCs** do very well in the **Public Square**, which indicates that money and material power have more immediate impact in shaping this environment.

### ④ Partnerships
This space is used by players to signal the issue most important to them. By placing their colored 📢 **Influence** cubes within this space, players signal their openness to potential collaborations in the discussion phase of each round.

### ④ Public Square
This represents the areas where actors communicate with the public and government to influence public opinion.
📢 Influence placed here indirectly affects Local Communities and directly affects Future Outcomes.
> ℹ️ **Tip**: In game terms, MNCs do very well in the Public Square, which indicates that money and material power have more immediate impact in shaping this environment.

### ⑤ Licensed AI
Any AI that is **licensed** is placed in this area with the player’s 📢 Influence token placed on it.

### Other Spaces
The remaining spaces on the board are used to record the current game turn round and score. Where possible, instructions for the gameplay are integrated into the board so keep an eye on the details written on each section.

<br>

# 🔄 Sequence of Play

Each game of *Raise Your Voice* takes place over three **rounds** (and a half). Each round has five **phases**. Each phase must be taken in order and completed in its entirety unless otherwise directed. 

For the first round, players should skip **Phase 1** and **2** and start with the **Action Phase**. This helps players get to grips with their role's goals and capabilities before introducing the **Leverage** and **AI tech** game dynamics.  At the end of the third round, **Future Outcomes** are determined. Players then calculate their total final scores to decide the winner.

> ℹ️ **Tip**: While five phases per round might seem daunting, the game is designed so that some of these phases run ‘automatically,’ and do not require more from players than a careful following of instructions. The player with most previous game experience should run these phases. 

> 💡 **Hint**: Recommended times for each phase are noted below. Some players will want to deliberate over decisions and examine every potential consequence but part of the power of games is that, as in real-life, decisions must sometimes be made with incomplete information or certainty.  

## ⓵ Discussion Phase
*⏱️ ~5 Minutes*

In this phase, players have five minutes only to discuss strategy, negotiate partnerships or even make threats! A summary of this phase is as follows:
- Set a timer for five minutes
- Discussions begin – players may or may not exchange Leverage cards
- Timer goes off – discussion ends
- In order, players may use Support cards they receive and may target another player with a Block action.
- Phase ends.

Players can agree to almost anything but may not break the rules or directly exchange any ⚡️. Beyond general discussions and planning, players may choose to engage in political responses to other players. Actors have special **Leverage** abilities that enable players to **Support** or **Block** other players in unique ways.

Each round a player may choose to give another player their **Support**. Once a card has been exchanged it may not be returned or given to another player. The recipient of this card may be able to use the gifting player’s Support ability. Alternatively, a player may decide to **Block** another player. In this case, the blocking player simply announces the target.

In both cases, the recipient cannot refuse to receive the other player's Support or Block ability. The recipient may choose not to use the Support ability if they choose, however they will not be able to hold it for a later round.

> ❗️ **Note:** Cards are used to signal support as they are a way of ensuring a binding commitment in the game. Once a player has received it, they can guarantee that they can use the special ability at the end of the discussion phase. Using cards like this ensures players are aggressive in meeting their needs early in the phase, rather than waiting to close deals at the end. It also prevents reneging on important deals.

The effects of Support and Block abilities are resolved at the end of the phase (after the timer goes off). Begin with the first player and move around the table. All Leverage cards are removed from play at the end of the round.

The back of the Scenario card defines the relationships between various actors. If relationships are **Neutral**, this has no effect on Leverage abilities. However, if relationship is **Poor**, those two players <ins>cannot</ins> Support each other; and if relationships are **Good**, that player should be given first refusal on Support.

Players may choose not to Support or Block anyone in the discussion phase. However, they may not use their Leverage abilities on themselves under any circumstances.

Any deals (beyond exchanging Support cards) that players make are subject to the restrictions of the Legal Culture (on the **Political Climate** card). The stronger the legal culture, the harder it is for players to renege on agreements without penalty. Specifically, legal culture works as follows:
- **Strong** — All agreements made in game are binding
- **Moderate** — If someone breaks an agreement or degrades the relationship, they must first pay other party 1 ⚡️
- **Weak** — No effect  

If the players cannot agree on whether an agreement was violated, a vote will be taken by the other three players to decide the issue (these players are encouraged to be as fair as possible in reaching their determination).

## ② AI Market Phase
*⏱️ ~5 Minutes*

In this phase players have an opportunity to take AI-related actions. AI tech that is researched by players may be placed into the **Licensed AI** Space. When this is done, this AI may now be used by the player who licensed it.

In addition, this player may agree to **license** this AI tech to other players, who must pay <ins>at least</ins> 1 ⚡️ to the owning player for the privilege. AI offers both opportunities and **vulnerabilities**.

While AI Tech may assist players in meeting some goals, they leave their users open to potential exploitation or harm. However, these potential vulnerabilities can be mitigated against. Every AI card also comes with a **Mitigation** printed on it.

If a player licenses an AI that mitigates the vulnerability on another of their AI tech, then they can ignore the effects of that vulnerability.

> 💡 **Hint**:  AI is a double-edged sword in the game. While the risks of harm are low compared to the potential benefits AI offers, the potential effects of vulnerabilities can be severe.

In this phase, beginning with the first player, each player takes an **AI action**. Continue until all players have taken all of their AI actions.

Different players are entitled to take a different number of free AI actions, based on their actor type as follows:
- **One AI actions**: CSOs, NGOs, Locals
- **Two AI actions**: MNCs
- **Three AI actions**: Researchers

The individual AI actions are as follows:
- **Research AI** — Draw two cards from the AI deck and discard one. Players may immediately take the ‘**License AI**’ action if they like.
- **License AI** — Pay 1 ⚡️ and place an **AI tech card** into the **Licensed AI** space. Place an 📢 Influence token on this card. Alternatively, pay at
least 1 ⚡️ to a player who owns this AI Tech. Place additional 📢 Influence
on this card to indicate shared use.

> 💡 **Hint**: Note that the license owner may charge any amount to another player or even refuse to consider any offer. However, they must charge at least 1 ⚡️.

Play in this phase continues until all players have used all their allowed **AI actions**. At any time, a player may choose to pass on their turn. However, once they have passed, they may not take any more **AI actions** later in this phase.

> ℹ️ **Tip**: Some AI cards take immediate effect while others enhance or impede abilities in other Phases. Pay attention to the effects as described on the card.

## ③ Action Phase
*⏱️ ~15 Minutes*

The action phase is the heart of the game and where players will focus much of their attention. In this phase, beginning with the first player, each player takes three actions. Once all players have taken their actions, the phase is completed.

Actions are selected from player’s mats and their role cards, meaning each player will have five distinct actions to choose from. Each action comes with a **requirement** and an **effect**. Provided players have the requirement, an action can be selected. Many actions depend on a **successful** dice roll. Read the details carefully.

> ℹ️ **Tip**: Many of the actions and decisions in the game depend on rolling a dice – and sometimes more than one – to determine their outcomes. The more dice you are asked to roll, the more likely you are to succeed. The number of dice required is marked with 🎲 emoji on all materials. If any of them show a **six**, it counts as a **success**. Some actions require a roll to determine a **failure**, which is any dice coming up **one**.

Actions usually involve:
- Placing 📢 Influence in either Local Communities or the Public Square
- Gaining additional ⚡️
- Adjusting government relationship
- Gaining advantage in the AI market
- Potentially meeting immediate goals
- Influencing Future Outcomes
- Placing Network Links (these potentially increase influence in Local
Communities)

> 💡 **Hint**: Each **actor** and role have distinct strengths and weaknesses. Identifying these is key to player success as doing so helps indicate with whom they should collaborate.


## ④ Political Developments Phase
*⏱️ ~5 Minutes*

### Stage 1: Resolve the Public Square
Determine in-game effects of Public Square:
1. **Mass Media:** Can attempt to place 📢 Influence in every Local Community. Roll 🎲 individually for each LC. If *successful*, place one 📢 Influence.
2. **Social Media:** Can attempt to affect a single Local Community. Roll 🎲. Place 📢 Influence or Network Link in the chosen LC for each *success* rolled.
3. **International Media:** Roll 🎲🎲🎲. If any are *successful*, receive ⚡️⚡️⚡️ (once, not per each success).

Determine long-term effects of Public Square influence:
1. Place all player 📢 Influence in media spaces into the **Future Outcomes** bag.
2. Place individual players’ 📢 Influence in Advocacy space directly onto **Future Outcomes** spaces on the board (owning player chooses).

### Stage 2: Local Community Activity
- Roll 🎲🎲🎲. For each *failure*, place one **Community Need** in a random LC if no Community Need already exists.
- If no LCs have a Community Need, place one in a random LC. 
- Roll 🎲🎲🎲🎲. If any failure rolled, an existing Community Need grows (add another Community Need token).
- Roll 🎲🎲🎲 for each **Link**. If *success* rolled, the Link strengthens (add 📢 Influence each for each actor connected to Link in either LC).

> 💡 **Hint**: Links can allow player   Influence in and between specific Local Communities to become stronger.

### Stage 3: Clean up
- Collect ⚡️ based on in-turn activity.
> ❗️ **Note:** Local Actors should check **Local Economy** on the **Political Climate** cardto see how their capital might be affected.
- Move First Player token to the left.
- At end of final round, resolve the **Future Outcomes** phase before final
scoring.

## ⑤ Government Activity Phase
*(do not conduct in round 3)*

In this phase the government acts in the game. The government is not represented by any player but instead is run automatically according to the stages below. It is recommended that the most experienced player/facilitator take on this task.

> ℹ️ **Tip**: In *Raise Your Voice* the government acts as a ‘sixth’ player that can strongly influence player actions. Governments are either ‘Free,’ ‘Obstructed’ or ‘Repressed.’ If they are Free, then they recede into the background and have no in-game effect. If they are in any way authoritarian, however, players will need to be careful to ensure that their **relationship** with the government is not too hostile as this can make some actions harder to take and can potentially subject players to damaging government crackdowns.

### Stage 1: Check Government Relationships
Check the **Civic Openness** (CO) level of the government, which is recorded on the **Political Climate** card. This determines the number of dice that need to be rolled for each player. If any *failure* is rolled, then the player must pay ⚡️ or degrade their **government relationship**. The dice rolled are as follows:
- **CO: Free** — Do nothing. Skip this stage.
- **CO: Obstructed** — Roll .
- **CO: Repressed** — Roll .

### Stage 2: Assuage Government
Players may offer some ⚡️ to improve Government Relations. For each ⚡️ (Obstructed) or ⚡️⚡️ (Repressed), improve **Government Relationship** by one.

### Stage 3: Potential Crackdown
Roll dice to see if a crackdown occurs based on Civic Openness as follows:
- Obstructive — 🎲
- Repressive — 🎲🎲

If a Crackdown occurs, then:
- Place **crackdown marker** in a random Local Community.
- For players with neutral or poor relationship with government:
    - No activity permitted in local community with crackdown this round.
    - Roll 🎲🎲 for each player **Network Link**. Remove if *failure* rolled.
- For all players with poor relationship with government:
    - Roll for each 📢 Influence in Local Communities. Remove if *failure* rolled.

> ℹ️ **Tip**: Government crackdowns can be extremely disruptive for players and can undo rounds of hard work. The best protection against them is to maintain a neutral relationship or improve government relationships to Good. If players find directly assuaging the government too costly, they should consider collaborating with Local actor who, due to their local knowledge, are able to more quickly get on the government’s good side.


### 🔮 Future Outcomes Phase
*(end of round 3 only)*

At the end of the third round, conduct the Future Outcomes phase as follows:

- Based on **Public Trust** level, withdraw the following amount of 📢 Influence tokens from the **Future Outcomes bag** and discard:
    - **Moderate:** 2
    - **Strong:** 0
    - **Weak:** 5
- Now draw out 📢 Influence tokens from the bag one at a time. When each token comes out the owning player can decide which Future Outcomes space to place it in.
- Continue drawing tokens until either:
    - A single Future Outcomes space holds **five tokens**, or
    - There are no tokens remaining in the bag.
- Once either condition is fulfilled, stop drawing tokens and prepare for final scoring.

<br>

## 🏁 Deciding the Outcome

Players win *RYV* by meeting in-game goals as well as shaping Future Outcomes. The final score for each player is determined as follows:

1. For MNC players only, remove a 🏆 point for each Negative Reputation remaining. 

2. Check **Future Outcome** space with most combined influence and check against **Scenario** card to score:
- **First** player receives 🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆 points
- **Second** receives 🏆🏆🏆 points
- **Third** receives 🏆 point

**The player with the highest score of 🏆 Victory Points wins.** 

In the event of a tie, the following players, in this order, determine which of the tied winners wins:
- **Local** – Workers, Business, Political Opposition
- **CSO** – Delivery, Advocacy

<br>

## 💬 Debrief

Studies have shown that players are more likely to internalize the ‘right’ lessons and discard the ‘wrong’ ones from a game if they are given an opportunity to debrief after the experience. It is strongly recommended that a proper debrief takes place at the end of the game to gain the most from the experience. On average a debrief should be about 20% the duration of the entire game time.

Debriefs should have two sections. The first section allows players to relive and analyze the game as a narrative experience and give them an opportunity to re!ect on the quality of the play. Here you can ask questions such as:
- What was the narrative of this game?
- Why did the winners win?
- What was your best action?
- What was the key moment of the game?

The second section of the debrief gives the players an opportunity to ‘break’ the game; that is expose the strengths and limits of the model and to consider these trade-offs when they reflect on the lessons the game taught. Examples of questions for this section include:
- Which dynamics were realistic?
- How do you win in this game? Is this how ‘winning’ works in the real world?
- What was missing from this game? How would its inclusion change things?
- Were the right players and their abilities represented in the game?
- What relevant players were missing? How does their presence change real-world examples of political action?
- Is there a strategy one can take from this game? Do others agree?
