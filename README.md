**5 PLAYERS | ~120 MINUTES (First Play mode) / 180 MINUTES (Full Play mode)**

*Raise Your Voice* is a strategic tabletop game exploring how AI impacts communities, governance and organizational strategies ‚Äî especially for those traditionally underserved or excluded from decision-making.

This game is already in use by **Accenture** and **partner organizations worldwide** and we're excited to make it publicly available soon. Whether you're a policymaker, civil society leader, researcher, technologist or educator, *Raise Your Voice* is designed to help you think systemically, collaboratively and critically about artificial intelligence.

üåç **Join us as we empower more people and organizations to shape an inclusive AI future.**

## üì¢ What is *Raise Your Voice*?

We are living through one of the most profound transformations in human history: the rise and rapid spread of artificial intelligence. From disaster response to education and public infrastructure, AI is reshaping our world ‚Äî but **who gets to decide how these technologies are developed, deployed and governed?**

Right now, many of those decisions are made far from the communities that feel AI's greatest impact. *Raise Your Voice* equips players ‚Äî from community organizers to global strategists ‚Äî to wrestle with these issues and game out the future.

### Inspired by Evidence-Based Research
*Raise Your Voice* is inspired by **Accenture** and **CARE International's** work on [*AI and the Global South*](https://careint.uk/AI-GlobalSouth-Report). That research identified a key gap: the people most affected by AI are often the least involved in shaping it.

This game is one response ‚Äî a **creative tool to provoke insight, discussion and action**.

## üé≤ How the Game Works

Players take on asymmetric roles like:
- **Civil Society Organizations (CSOs)**
- **Non-Governmental Organizations (NGOs)**
- **Multinational Corporations (MNCs)**
- **Researchers**
- **Local Actors** (e.g., workers, small businesses, informal networks ‚Äî even criminals!)

Over **three rounds**, players:
- Navigate shifting **political climates**
- Debate and build alliances in the **Public Square**
- Deploy or resist **AI technologies**
- Influence **Local Communities**
- Face moral and strategic dilemmas around AI's deployment

The gameplay is grounded in:
- **Participatory design**
- **Intentional asymmetry** (some players have power, others need allies)
- **Tough trade-offs**: Do you prioritize solving immediate community needs over influencing future policy?
